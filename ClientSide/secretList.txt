# hahaha there is nothing here

Welcome to the ClientSide CTF Room!

Riddle me this, oh codebreaker bold,
In the world of encoding, secrets are told.
Start with a twist, ROT13 unfolds,
Yet deeper mysteries, the story holds.

Rot47 comes next, a cipher so tight,
Shifting characters left, beyond the night.
Base16 whispers softly in hexadecimal,
A language of numbers, a secret spell.

Continue the journey with Base32's grace,
A dance of bits in a ciphered embrace.
And finally, behold the power of Base64,
Encoded whispers that only you'll know.

Decode the layers, unveil the key,
To access the secrets, set them free.
Crack the code, unveil the pride,
The flag awaits on the ClientSide.

Best of luck, brave code adventurer!
